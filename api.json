      "summary": "Malaysian ghost of a deceased person whose soul remains trapped within their white Islamic burial shroud (kain kafan). Appears as a white-wrapped figure that hops or floats near graveyards at night, unable to move freely because the shroud was not properly untied after burial.",
      "full": "The hantu bungkus, literally 'wrapped ghost' in Malay, is the restless spirit of a deceased person whose body remains bound in their kain kafan (white Muslim burial shroud) in the grave. According to Islamic funeral traditions, the shroud's binding cords should be loosened before burial so the soul can be free in the afterlife. When this is forgotten or improperly performed, the soul becomes trapped and rises as a hantu bungkus. The ghost appears as a white-wrapped figure with no visible limbs, hopping or floating vertically because its legs remain bound. It haunts graveyards, disturbed burial sites, and occasionally follows mourners home. The hantu bungkus typically exhibits more mischievous than malevolent behavior, though it may frighten people or knock on doors and windows at night. The entity represents respect for Islamic burial practices and the importance of proper funeral rites. It is closely related to the Indonesian pocong but has distinct Malaysian cultural elements and variations in behavior."
